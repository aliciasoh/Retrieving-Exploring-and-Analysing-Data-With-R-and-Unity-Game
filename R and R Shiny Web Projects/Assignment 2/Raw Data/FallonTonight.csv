Why is that? BECAUSE this is not a type of insurance that one buys and hopes to never need to use it!Health insurance coverage is purchased by folks who know in advance they will need to use it and so do those insurance companies who sell the health insurance! And because we have an archaic health insurance system in place which does not ""work,"" no group purchase big or small local or national, will bring costs down!How do we then need to approach health coverage? We need a whole new approach which is akin to Social Security and Medicare. Why is that? Because unless absolutely everyone ""buys in"" then the old broken system of cheap for the young and healthy, verses expensive for the poor elderly and ill, will continue down the same wrong road and fall into the bottomless moneypit that awaits!How do other nations who provide health insurance for ALL of their citizens approach national health coverage? It isn\'t about ""competition"" and a false promise of lower premiums and the lie of more covereage!What do I mean? We are not going to FIX what\'s wrong by attempting to apply an arrangement that\'s doomed before it hits the Senate floor for a vote!!! There are times when a government MUST take up the cause for all of it\'s citizens ~ national health coverage is imperative for our nation IF we are truly serious that every single American citizen have fair affordable health coverage!!!National Health Coverage. Why can\'t everyone fill out just one more form when employeed that has one check for ""self"" or for ""family"" and have a national health insurance withheld from wages? Have it all go into one fund and out of that insure everyone. Everyone gets a medical ID card. Everyone gets health insurance covereage with the emphasis on preventative well-care. Everyone gets a yearly physical and whatever tests are needed appropriate to age and gender. Everyone pays and everyone is covered.Why does this need to be hundreds or thousands of pages or hours of debate? Just one form that everyone fills out. No exemptions. No opting out. No excuses. Those who are unable to work can file for special coverage. Why does it have to be so complicated? Why does it have to depend on where one lives, what the popuation, etc. And why can\'t our country decide once and for all that everyone deserves to have health insurance and medical care whether they are rich or poor?Well, I\'m guessing if we took all the current budgeted monies that go for this health progam and that health program, and all the monies individual citizens pay in already, it would be fully funded to have a national health insurance plan. And if it was a matter of more budgetary funding needed, then everyone\'s amount would be adjusted. If everyone paid the same X percent of wages earned, no one would pay more than they could afford. No one rich would pay a less percentage than a poor person. And a poor person would not get a freebie, but pay a X percent of their wages.Can\'t we come up with a fair simple workable idea that benefits every American fairly without unjustly making the most vulnerable pay the most and those who are rich pay the least? Why should we have insurance companies making a profit off of each of our health needs? Is that necessary?By the way, everyone who drives must have vehicle insurance. Everyone who borrows on a home has mortgage insurance. We take out flood and fire insurance, renters insurance, life insurance. We all fill out a W-2 for withholding purposes for employment wages earned. Why can\'t we each fill out a form for withholding purposes for X% to be withheld from wages earned? We pay taxes for roads, schools, purchases, and earnings. Why can\'t we each pay X% for national health insurance? There are brilliant minds who know how to set this up fairly so that no one is left out and no one pays more than their share, and no one who can pay gets to opt out.As a nation, we have plenty to go around...why don\'t we take care of each other and just agree to have National Health Coverage? We know what it costs to provide care. There are super computers to project what it would cost. Can\'t we do this for ourselves as a nation? If we can register to vote when we get a driver\'s license, why can\'t we register for National Health Coverage when we get a job?","Competition to purchase health insurance across state lines will NOT bring down the cost of health insurance!

A couple of months ago you had a concert in NY at the Barclays center on October 8th. My girlfriend Lindsay and I were supposed to attend.  I purchased these tickets for her 23rd birthday which was September 14th!! She is a huge fan of yours, she probably likes you more than me.. well we never actually got to go to the concert. On September 15th I was riding my motorcycle with a couple buddies when a young kid just happened to pull out in front of us. Fortunately only one of us was injured. Unfortunately that one person was me. I bounced off of the car and was ejected into a telephone pole which stopped me from moving. I was rushed to a nearby trauma hospital with life threatening injuries. The police on scene, and the EMT didn\'t think I would make it through the night.  Well they were wrong!! I actually survived 2 collapsed lungs, 1 punctured lung, brain bleeding, a lacerated liver, kidney, and spleen. I also fractured 3 ribs 8 vertebrae in my neck and back, and also fractured both shoulder blades. After about 10 days in trauma ICU I was moved to another room to finish my recovery.  I spent a total of 15 days in the hospital.  My girlfriend never left my side and kept praying for me and made my stay in the hospital very comforting.. now because of this horrible accident . We were un able to make the trip to Brooklyn. It is now a couple months later and she still has to help me shower, eat, walk, drive me around to my doctors appointments and I was just hoping maybe you would see this letter and help me give her the birthday present she deserves. All she wants is to see you in concert. It would just make her day and make her smile which is all I want to do!! Hopefully this letter makes it to Blake Shelton somehowThanks-Jonathan DanielsA huge country fan!! Please share for me!!!","Dear Blake Shelton,I know this is a long shot but it\'s worth a try in my eyes. A couple of months ago you had a concert in NY at the Barclays center on October 8th.
