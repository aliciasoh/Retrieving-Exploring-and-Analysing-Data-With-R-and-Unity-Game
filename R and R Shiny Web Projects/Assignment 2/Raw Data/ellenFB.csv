I always wanted to be Kobe Bryant
Our situations were quite different 
He wanted to touch the rim
And I wanted to touch the ground just listen.

Sometimes I wish to be just like others
But they are not warriors
They don't have what it takes
To fight for your life day after day 

At birth I was like you
Can eat, stand and dance
But at 4 years old the syndrome hit
And you wouldn't of thought I have the chance 

 Although my heart was failing
It didn't affect my love
I kept the spirit 
And asked for the man up above 

See you were above the rim
You can jump so high
While I was in a walker 
But can still touch the sky  

Although I can touch the sky 
I wanted to touch the ground 
I wanted to walk 
I wanted to let out a sound

I dreamed of screaming 
making lots of noise
And then... I woke up 
Just silence and toys 

The meds are kicking in
It's time for me to stop 
I can finally touch the ground

I always wanted to be Kobe Bryant
Our situations were quite different 
He wanted to touch the rim
And I wanted to touch the ground just listen.

Sometimes I wish to be just like others
But they are not warriors
They don't have what it takes
To fight for your life day after day 

At birth I was like you
Can eat, stand and dance
But at 4 years old the syndrome hit
And you wouldn't of thought I have the chance 

 Although my heart was failing
It didn't affect my love
I kept the spirit 
And asked for the man up above 

See you were above the rim
You can jump so high
While I was in a walker 
But can still touch the sky  

Although I can touch the sky 
I wanted to touch the ground 
I wanted to walk 
I wanted to let out a sound

I dreamed of screaming 
making lots of noise
And then... I woke up 
Just silence and toys 

The meds are kicking in
It's time for me to stop 
I can finally touch the ground 
Now it's time to work on my shot",10155340476562240_10155347185422240,2017-03-13T20:01:19+0000,Daniel Martinez,10205338078391265,"Pick me, pick me...

I always wanted to be Kobe Bryant
Our situations were quite different 
He wanted to touch the rim
And I wanted to touch the ground just listen.

Sometimes I wish to be just like others
But they are not warriors
They don't have what it takes
To fight for your life day after day 

At birth I was like you
Can eat, stand and dance
But at 4 years old the syndrome hit
And you wouldn't of thought I have the chance 

 Although my heart was failing
It didn't affect my love
I kept the spirit 
And asked for the man up above 

See you were above the rim
You can jump so high
While I was in a walker 
But can still touch the sky  

Although I can touch the sky 
I wanted to touch the ground 
I wanted to walk 
I wanted to let out a sound

I dreamed of screaming 
making lots of noise
And then... I woke up 
Just silence and toys 

The meds are kicking in
It's time for me to stop 
I can finally touch the ground 
Now it's time to work on my shot",10155330445852240_1866252956956107,2017-03-11T01:41:46+0000,Judy McAuliff,10202945267824515,Ellen-you truly posted the funniest stuff!

I have two LGBT siblings, and my mother accepted them and loved them even when the world turned their back on them. A lot of the time, when she would watch your show, she would mention how much love you had. She would mention the things you did for people, and the money you gave people. And then she would tell me how little money meant to her and how you had all the right ideas.

My mother passed away on Monday, March 6th. And the funeral is tomorrow. My family is in need. She has 7 children that are spread out across the East Coast. We need traveling money to get her buried in Indiana, as we live in West Virginia. 

I am only 19 years old, and I have been planning the funeral. We have a Gofundme set up for the costs, and I'm not asking you to give, but if you could get the word out, I would be so thankful, for the rest of my life.

He recently relocated to California in 2014 to pursue his career as an actor and recording artist. He has been producing music and writing lyrics under pseudonym ""LC""  He cities his main influences as the hiphop artists he spent his youth listenings to, Lil Wayne, Jay Z and Future. He is honored to have met the Legendary Bootsy Collins, he quoted ""I love it when a young brother is un-stoppable and clean with swag""  

While still in high school he wrote & produced his first single ""Twang"" and it instantly became a hit, he has a huge fan base that loves it and supports him. He remembers practicing for hours on his Akai beat machine trying to make the perfect beat ‚Ä¶ well guess what .. it worked. Once he honed his skills as a rapper he entered rap battles and he caught the attention of a local program director, Chuck Atkins at Clear Channel Radio who started spinning his songs in regular rotation. The buzz about this talented rapper started to build in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and influential music industry insiders, Kevin Irving (RIP) at Kirv Entertainment and program director, Reggie Brown at V100.7 began to take notice. His songs were featured on a signet called ""Heat from the streets"" and the fans went crazy. The stage was set for this young heart throb, he began receiving special invites to perform at local events, back to school festivals and birthday parties.  

The Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel requested to feature him in an article ""Music and Night Life"" section. In the article he expressed his love for music and how he will be an inspiration to the youths advising them to always follow your dreams and to never give up. Not only is he mastering his passion for music, he is also a working actor in California. He has several movie credits for film, Dope, Duffle and Exit Zero. He is also featured in commercials, Finishline, McDonalds, Swiffer by P&G, Apple Music and Fresh Empire. Listen closely when you hear ""Fresh Empire"" commercial ‚Ä¶ thats the voice of Christopher Glenn, yes!! 

He will be the driving force in the entertainment world in the years to come. He plans to drop his mix tape by the end of this year. He has a very special place that he retreats to when he studies scripts and create music, he calls it ""The Zen Cocoon"".  He is definitely headed in the right direction and will continue to pursue his acting career and his music career both all at the same time, as said best by his Mgr/Momager Sinora ‚Ä¶ You can do anything once you put your mind to it .. Just make it happen son!!

13 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

Because that man has alot of hate . That's is what is killing this world is hate . So if Ellen can make someone anyone out there smile that didnt smile that day or laugh out of a 60 min show. Well then all I can say is job well done . You know Brad there are people out in this so called world we live in that really have nothing and if they look up to her or watch her to get joy out of a day whats so wrong with that . How can you say she is so bad you dont even know her you have never meet her. You are only going by what you hear. You are judging someone by what you hear. Maybe you should sit back and just enjoy her show and smile maybe even get a laugh now and then and just stop your hateing . It really is whats wrong with people today to much hate.

I also became a single parent with two children under two years old.  I finally finished December of 2015 and crossed that stage June 2016 (at 37 years of age) to earn that 4 year degree (though it took me 13 years to complete). I made sure my two babies were there and I created a bursary at the school so that other single parents can achieve their goals.
